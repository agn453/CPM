# CPM
CP/M Emulator for RSX280

This repository contains a CP/M emulator for the RSX280 operating system.

It is written in Zilog Z280 assembly language and is based on an earlier
version for UZI280 (a unix edition 7 operating system for the Z280)
by Stefan Nitscke and released into the Public Domain in 1996.

RSX280 is being developed by Hector Peraza and is available from
https://github.com/hperaza/RSX280

****  NOTE: THIS IS NOT YET A WORKING VERSION  ****

CPM is a program to allow "well-behaved" Z80 CP/M programs to run
under RSX280.  The implementation only supports basic CP/M 2.2
BDOS functionality and console-only BIOS routines.  None of the
usual CP/M 2.2 BIOS disk, printer, punch and reader are available.

Further documentation will be added at a later time.
