# CPM
CP/M Emulator for RSX280
========================

This repository contains a CP/M emulator for the RSX280 operating system.

It is written in Zilog Z280 assembly language and is based on an earlier
version for UZI280 (a unix edition 7 operating system for the Z280)
by Stefan Nitschke and released into the Public Domain in 1996.

RSX280 is being developed by Hector Peraza and is available from
https://github.com/hperaza/RSX280

****  NOTE: THIS IS NOW A TENTATIVE WORKING VERSION  ****

CPM is a program to allow "well-behaved" Z80 CP/M programs to run
under RSX280.  The implementation only supports basic CP/M 2.2
BDOS functionality and console-only BIOS routines.  None of the
usual CP/M 2.2 BIOS routines for accessing other disk drives,
or character devces like a printer, punch and reader are
available.

Further documentation will be added at a later time.

Revision history is now in reverse chronological order.


Update: 12-Jun-2020
-------------------

Reorganise source-code and improve comments.  Only minor functional
changes to the emulation of the CP/M file control block contents
have been made.

There are some outstanding issues -

* Console input sometimes gets out-of-sync when the terminal input
AST routine adds a character to the input ring buffer (we have no
control over disabling/enabling RSX280 system interrupts).

* Still to-do CP/M allocation vector emulation so that directory
accessing programs can see and report on disk usage.

* Files opened for updating from CP/M do not seem to be writing
file sectors for existing files (e.g. running a configuration
program to update a terminal-type do not change the first sector
record in a .COM file where these things are stored).


Update: 26-May-2020
-------------------

Search First/Search Next (BDOS functions 17 & 18) are mostly working.
Contiguous files from RSX280 (mainly task image *.TSK files) are
not being returned to the emulation.

The Digital Research SDIR program is generally working and able to
list out the CP/M directory with file sizes.  The size of CP/M extents
is not yet consistent though - and I'm investigating whether an
emulation of the allocation vector bitmap is needed.  The disk
parameter block values in-use emulate an 8Mb hard disk with up to
1024 directory entries.  STAT *.* also reports correct file
information.

I've changed command input routine so that it may no longer accept
program filenames from another user directory.  Instead I'll be
considering adding a search-path instead - so if a CP/M program is
not in the user's home directory then another directory will be
searched (most likely SY0:[CPM]).

Also I've used the CP/M assembler ASM on DUMP.ASM and loaded the
resultant LOAD.HEX file to produce a running DUMP.COM and tried
out a CP/M visual editor (I use PMATE) to edit test files.
Infocom games like ZORK I and Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
also work fine.


Update: 18-May-2020
-------------------

I've been through a few iterations trying to implement the BDOS search_first
and search_next functions (17 and 18).  At first I tried using RSX280
native directory searching like the PIP program uses - but this ended
up being too complex and large (and it doesn't scale if you have a
large number of files in your home directory).

As a consequence, I've approached this from the CP/M BDOS source
and made some assumptions.  Firstly, all files visible from CP/M
*MUST* be only eight-character filenames (not nine), and only
files with version number 1 (e.g. FILE.DAT;1) are seen by CP/M
(as FILE.DAT).

I'm using the RSX280 FCS routines to walk through the user's
directory and computing file sizes (in CP/M records of 128-bytes)
by looking up the SY:[MASTER]INDEXF.SYS;1 index file.  I'm able to
do a Search First and Search Next to retrieve the correct results
the first time through, however, trying a second time fails.  I'm
suspicious of problems with the system's FSEEK routine and will
just post a "where I'm at" snapshot and look at it further soon.
Debugging messages are everywhere at present.


Update: 07-May-2020
-------------------

BDOS Console I/O and sequential File functions are working.

Still to-do Search First/Next functions and verify Random File
functions.

Update: 01-May-2020
-------------------

The original UZI280 version was missing some CP/M BDOS functions.
These have been added.  Console I/O and Disk file Open/Create/Read/Write
appear to be working.   Still to-do file Remove, Random access Read/Write,
Directory Search and some other BDOS functions.
