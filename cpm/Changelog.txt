Changelog (HP)
--------------

Starting from Tony Nicholson's V0.99

18/12/21

- Switched to direct QIO calls for file I/O instead of using FCSLIB. While
  FCSLIB provides a convenient a C-like interface to file I/O operations,
  it may be a bit overkill for this application that requires fixed 128-byte
  record I/O. QIO calls also help to reduce buffer space since we can do I/O
  directly to/from the application area, increasing TPA by about 3K. OTOH,
  reading partial blocks means 4 times more QIO calls, meaning also more
  context-switching, which may reduce performance.

- We can get rid of the PFN call as well, since CP/M FCBs are easy to convert
  to RSX280 FDBs (~600 more bytes freed.)

- Use a simple CP/M drive to RSX280 directory mapping table. Only two drives
  supported at the moment: SY:[UserDir] and SY:[CPM]. Still TODO: implement
  DPBs and DPHs for the new drive(s).

- Under CP/M files open for read do not have to be closed, and that creates
  a problem for RSX280, which can quickly run out of LUNs. For UZI180, a
  rather crude solution was implemented: a single file descriptor was used
  for all I/O operations, the UZI file was normally kept open until an
  explicit file close call, a file open call, or a read or write operation
  with a different FCB than the last one. At that point the old file was
  closed and a new one was opened, and so on. Performance was still very
  acceptable, perhaps due to the fact that most CP/M applications process
  several files either sequentially or in large chunks. For RSX280, we'll
  do something similar, but instead of reserving one file descriptor we'll
  use four LUNs arranged in a LRU list.

- Had to move a few more routines into the BIOS area.

- Adapted the read directory and index file routines.

- Load COM file using BDOS calls (this is in preparation for using a genuine
  or adapted CCP.COM as the command interpreter in the future).

- Place the CCP stack in the TPA area below BDOS start, so it will not be
  overwritten by the BDOS stack when using BDOS services.

- Now using ODT as debugger (conditionally included). This makes debugging
  easier than via $PSTR calls.

- Fixed a bug in sz_compute which caused the computed file size to become
  negative in certain cases.

- When building a fake directory for file search first/next, clear s1 and s2
  bytes, else the compare loop 'searchloop' will very likely fail.

- Build emulator task to load at address of 0000h, else the kernel will not
  allow file I/O below the usual 0100h task bottom limit (particularly I/O
  to the default CP/M buffer at 0080h will not be allowed.) This was not a
  problem with FCSLIB, since I/O was done to/from a buffer in high memory.

- Simple applications (e.g. DUMP) are already working. Other ones (e.g. DDTZ)
  crash the emulator with a 'privileged instruction' error, as they use Z280
  privileged instructions such as 'ei', 'di', 'ld a,i', etc. TODO: setup
  a SST vector table to catch and emulate (or ignore) such instructions.


20/12/21

- Support BDOS function 40 (RSX280 does the zero-fill).

- If a file cannot be open in r/w mode, try r/o mode.

- BDOS function 35 (compute file size) now computes file size from the
  RSX280 file attributes (faster than doing a search first/next call.)


21/12/21

- The command tail @0080h should include the space separator.

- Removed the code that parsed the command line tail into a set of argv[]
  (leftover from UZI280, more space freed). The main routine now simply
  looks for a file matching the first argument and passes the remainder
  of the command line to the application.

- Read/Write random record should set the sequential file position.

- More programs tested: ASM, MAC, RMAC, DR LINK, MBASIC, T3XZ compiler,
  Turbo Pascal 3.0; all seem to be working OK.

- Fixed the delete and rename functions; now PIP succeeds copying a file.


23/12/21

- BDOS function 35: reverted changes back to computing size via directory
  scan, as the function does not require the file to be open.

- Extent size is larger than 128 for the emulated 4-block "disk". The search
  first/next functions now take into account the extent mask; this keeps
  NULU happy and also fixes the problem of large files being reported twice
  (or more) in a search next function.

- CP/M BDOS returns zero for illegal function numbers. This is used by some
  applications that issue special ZSDOS calls to determine whether they are
  running under ZSDOS or vanilla CP/M.


26/12/21

- Implemented BDOS functions 14 (select disk), 25 (get current disk) and 24
  (get login vector). The login vector is used to avoid a time-consuming
  re-logging of an already logged-in disk in function 14.

- Function 13 (reset disk system) now clears the login vector and re-logins
  the currently selected disk (note: the real CP/M always resets the current
  disk to A).

- The main routine now allows changing the current disk with a 'd:' command
  like CP/M CCP does.

- Reset the BDOS if an application exits via warm boot vector or BDOS
  function 0, but not if it restores the stack and returns to CCP.
